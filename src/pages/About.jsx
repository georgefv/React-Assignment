                    Modern Architect was founded in September 2014 by Özgür Sevgili, as a digital space where he could collect thousands of inspirational architectural photography for his own independent architecture company which he runs in İstanbul, Turkey. As an accomplished architect and an entrepreneur, he was very well aware of the fact that there were few architectural pages on Instagram at the time. So, with an immediate urge, then and there he made up his mind to fill this void and founded Modern Architect.
